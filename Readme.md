# EPIONE Scheduler

This a technical assessment project for EPIONE's React Native developer position.

What you're seeing is a prorotype for a simple scheduler application.
The intention is to display a week overview containing the events arranged for that week.

This application has been created using [Expo](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

To complete the assessment:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to it
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run it locally: `expo start`
4. Read the [issues](https://gitlab.com/raymundo.vasquezruiz.epione/epione-scheduler/-/issues?sort=created_asc) description
5. Solve or implement the [issues](https://gitlab.com/raymundo.vasquezruiz.epione/epione-scheduler/-/issues?sort=created_asc). Preferably create branches or merge requests per issue in order to review the changes in isolation ðŸ™‚
6. Upload your solution to a personal repository (Gitlab or Github) and send us the link back.


Feel free to remove, add or refactor any component or the project itself. Show us how you'll bring a small idea closer to production ðŸ’ª
